Dimensionality reduction methods including PCA and tSNE.
The tSNE method was implemented from scratch, and there are references to the math formulas used to implement it.
There is a result comparison of the built-from-scratch method with the canned t-SNE from scikit, to demonstrate that they both return same results.
The built-from-scratch method takes more time to run that the scikit version.
